Ultra Stylized Grass is a material-based asset designed to give you an extremely optimized drag and drop stylized grass solution with an abundant of variety. With many different material instances to choose from, you can create very optimized dense fields of grass with ease. The package contains 4 main master materials, and 18 material instances, along with a simple landscape material. Each material instance can be easily edited to change things like wind direction, wind size, color, hue, etc. Check out the demo above for more information, and to see the performance in action! Also I highly recommend checking out the video.
